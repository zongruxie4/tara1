## Git

This plugin provides utilities related to Git.

### `:Gclone` command

**Syntax:** `:Gclone URL [dir-name]`

Clones repository, optionally deriving target directory name from the URL.  On
success, enters the newly cloned worktree.  On failure, shows the error in a
dialog.

**Examples:**

 * Clone into directory called `vifm`:
   ```
   :Gclone https://github.com/vifm/vifm.git
   ```

 * Clone into directory called `vifm-dev`:
   ```
   :Gclone https://github.com/vifm/vifm.git vifm-dev
   ```

**Parameters:**

 1. URL to clone from (required).
 2. Destination (optional).  Derived from the last component of the URL removing
    `.git` suffix.

### `:Gmap` command

**Syntax:** `:Gmap pattern replacement`

Adds a simple replacement rule for Git statuses.  Each new rule is appended to
the list.  The rules are processed in the order of their definition, therefore
earlier ones have higher priority and rules with wildcards should follow more
specific ones.

**Examples:**

 * `:Gmap D* x` marks files that are deleted in index (`D ` and `DU`) with `x`.
 * `:Gmap ?? —` replaces `??` with `—`.

**Parameters:**

 1. Pattern (required).  A two-character sequence where `*` is used as a
    wildcard that matches any character.
 2. Replacement (required).

### `GitStatus` view column

When inside a Git repository, displays status of files and directories in a way
similar to how `git status --short` does it.

**Possible column values for files:**

| Value | Meaning
| ----- | -------
| `  `  | Ignored or unchanged.
| ` M`  | Modified in worktree.
| `MM`  | Modified in index and in worktree.
| `AM`  | Added in index, modified in worktree.
| `RM`  | Renamed in index, modified in worktree.
| `M `  | Modified in index.
| `A `  | Added in Index.
| `R `  | Renamed in index.
| `D `  | Deleted in index.
| ` D`  | Deleted in worktree.
| `MD`  | Modified in index, deleted in worktree.
| `AD`  | Added in index, deleted in worktree.
| `RD`  | Renamed in index, deleted in worktree.
| `UD`  | Updated here, but deleted in merged changes.
| `DU`  | Deleted here, but updated in merged changes.
| `AA`  | Added here and in merged changes.
| `UU`  | Modified here and in merged changes.
| `??`  | Untracked.

**Possible column values for directories:**

 * Any of the values for files.
 * If a subtree has multiple files modified, each character of the status is
   merged like this:
   * space + space = space
   * space + non-space = non-space
   * non-space + identical non-space = non-space
   * non-space + different non-space = 'X'
   * 'X' + anything = 'X'

**Example:**

 * `:set viewcolumns=-3{GitStatus},*{name}..,6{}.`

**Issues:**

 * Has a noticeable initial delay for large Git repositories due to fetching
   statuses synchronously.

**TODO:**

 * Make cache update faster if directory modification is detected.
 * Check if `!!` status can ever be seen.
 * Consider using `git status --porcelain=v2 -z` as it provides more
   information.
 * Consider marking ignored files as such.
 * Using `libgit2` could improve performance.
